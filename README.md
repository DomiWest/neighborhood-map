# Project: Neighborhood Map
***
#### Project Overview

>The project's goal was to develop a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood or a neighborhood I would like to visit. It was required to add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

#### Application Description
>My idea to match the project requirements was to develop an application which shows a website with a header and a map of my hometown Nuremberg in Germany. The map includes 10 location-markers of locations in Nuremberg that are either famous in the world or important to me personally. Clicking on the menu icon opens a sidebar menu with a list of all those locations and a input field which filters the list and only shows the remaining location-filters on the map. Clicking on one of the markers opens an infowindow which is populated with the location's name and an URL to an wikipedia article about the location.


#### Execute the sourcecode
There are two ways to run the application:

* Live Demo: [Neighborhood Map Nuremberg]()    
* Download this repo and open `maps.html` in any browser.
